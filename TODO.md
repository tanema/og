# TODO
- [x] Nice Error output

- [x] Output cached status's
- [x] Output Elapsed times
    - [x] package elsapsed (from output)
    - [x] test elapsed will have to time ourselves. Start on run, pause, cont, done. Then sum
- [x] Relative filenames (remove package name) https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mod/modfile#File
- [x] watch command
- [x] output/rank tests that take the longest

    - [x] run all tests in a single file will require finding all tests in the file
- [x] support go test flags
  - [x] --nocache (-count=1)
  - [x] -count
  - [x] -parallel
  - [x] -short
  - [x] -vet=all
  - [x] -race
  - [x] -covermode atomic -coverprofile profile.out
  - [x] -failfast
  - [x] -shuffle=on
- [x] fix watch
- [x] Config
  - [x] Flags
    - [x] Disable Skip output
    - [x] Disable elapsed
    - [x] Disable summary
    - [x] Show no test packages
    - [x] Rank threshold or number

- [x] outputs Better syntax highlighting
  - [x] all logging/display to stderr
  - [x] watch timestamp improvement
  - [x] watch no tests output
  - [x] highlight all filenames with line numbers in cyan
  - [x] can I parse build errors?
    - [x] panic in tests is not captured. Writing to nil buf
    - [x] build error output still isnt quite right
    - [x] build error excerpts?
- [x] More Better inputs
  - relative paths prefixed with ./
  - if dir has no tests then suffix with /... nope, just make it not fail
- [x] go build, install, test
- [ ] term hotkeys to re-run all
- [ ] install test deps if an error happens
- [ ] go vet output support
